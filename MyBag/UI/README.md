# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# MyBag-MERN
It is a MERN Stack Project, yes it is a Full Stack Project💯. This project is focused on building a 
Minimalistic Modern Shopping Website and used various new technologies to make this project a 
standout in impactful user friendly UI.

In this project I have used various technologies including✔️ - 

HTML                      Rect-icons                dotenv
CSS                       bcrypt.js                 redux
JS                        JWT                       cookie-parser
REACT.JS                  Cloudinary                axios
NODE.JS                   Mongoose                  BootStrap
MONGODB ATLAS             Multer                    Lint 
Lucide React              Cors                      Nodemon

👏This many technologies used in this project letting it becoming a absolute standout in the niche 
of web developement.


Process:

I used amazon and Meesho quite a lot for ordering my desirable items on internet and everytime I 
used any of those It was too much bother some to read about products. too much bogus and way out-
dated representation for absolute detail. I never like the arrange of structese they used that 
made it look even a lot worse. this Unstructured and Ignorance towards UI brought me inspiration
to try push myself and Re-Create something soothinga and Interesting. 

though Meesho is not like that much of hated platform I really like it icons and modern approach 
where It became to stand the foundation for this project to use modernity in this project too.

UI🌱

I created the UI which was whole lot of different then what it is right now. at some time earlier I
was just learing about the UI of web developement I suddenly come to visit on to MERN Stack project 
of Siddharth Mukherjee on Youtube where he became my first expressoin of inspiration I admired his 
way of representing and plannig structure. So, while the process was going on I had very high expec
-tations from myself but It seems that I got to make myself Keep being grounded to the surface and 
don't think of myself on such high level I am just starting and feeling Like I am best from everyone 
else. but my design were I believe were really intersting but they were so much flasy and inconsitent 
without any color Scheme at all so that is why I now have followed @Siddhart Mukharjee's layout and 
structure to make myself vulnerable and humilated from the very start of my career that I have to 
find constant motivation and surpass myself what I was yesterday,

so from here I had the UI from Sidharth Mukherjee's walkthrough of his E-commerce Webpage and My 
website is whole based on that inspiration.

BackEnd 🖥️

Backend is Completely My learning phase I created backend just on very of my own processig of my men
-tal abilities. Current working of my Backend is my learning phase it might seem too perfect but, I want 
to make sure that I was keen to learn something new and finalised to learnt React-Redux to managa states 
for my project.

Previously whole logic of my project was written in Node.js's express routing library. having hardcoded 
routes for each process. but I decided to push my self and learnt Redux and to apply it right away on 
to my MYBAG project. where I perfecetly upgrade each section of logic with state management and dynamic 
processing 

in this redux journey I learnt to manage my pages dynamically as there exists no sturcture for my different
pages like     - Login, Register, Address page, Orderpages, Category page

These section of my project doesn't have any dedicated files that is responsible to render these page individ-
ully, rather I practiced my learning to render pages dynamically, each component of all these pages is stored 
in One(single) file and that common file is utilesed to render these many differnt pages collectively.

I love to share this that this part was difficult no doubt, but it is my favourite part of whole program.

Styling/CSS 😎

In this project I used - BootStrap - as my styling partener to use quick styling throughout my project.

I used Icons form Lucide-React and React Icons that helped me giving it a modular appeal. 
used React components and speacial libraries to use {Toasts, Checkbox etc} 
throughout project that provides necessary information whilst interacting with website .
