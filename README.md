<h1>🧠 SPOTT: Full Stack Social Media Platform</h1>
“I didn’t choose the bug life. The bug life chose me.”

Welcome to SPOTT, the social media platform I built to prove to myself (and the world) that I can wrestle with unfamiliar tech stacks and come out victorious — or at least mildly bruised but wiser.

<h1>🚀 What Is This?</h1>
SPOTT is a full-stack social media platform built as a personal challenge and a showcase of my web development skills. Think of it as my digital gladiator arena — where I fought Django, SVGs, and my own sanity.

This project is my way of saying: “Hey mentors, future colleagues, clients, and random internet wanderers — I know my way around web development. And yes, I willingly dove into technologies that previously made me break out in hives.”

<h1>🤯 Why Did I Do This to Myself?</h1>
As a seasoned MERN developer, I could’ve stayed in my comfort zone. But no — I decided to tango with Django and SVGs, two things that were as alien to me as quantum physics and social interaction before coffee.

Django REST Framework: Because Python APIs are cool, and I wanted to suffer a little.

SVGs: Because why use PNGs when you can spend hours trying to animate vector graphics and question your life choices?


<h1>🧪 Tech Stack Breakdown</h1>
<h1>🛠️ Backend</h1>
Django REST Framework – For building robust APIs and testing my patience.

PostgreSQL – Managed via psycopg2-binary, because raw SQL wasn’t spicy enough.

Gunicorn – WSGI server that runs the app while I run from bugs.

WhiteNoise – For serving static files and white-knuckling deployment.

<h1>🎨 Frontend </h1>
React.js – Because I still love JavaScript, even if it doesn’t love me back.

Vite – Ultra-fast build tool that made me feel like a frontend ninja.

Tailwind CSS – Utility-first styling that’s both beautiful and confusing.

React Router – Smooth routing, smoother developer tears.

Lucide Icons – For UI components that scream “I tried.”

 <h1> 📚 What I Learned</h1>
Django is not just a fancy name — it’s a whole new world.

SVGs are magical, scalable, and mildly infuriating.

Full-stack development is a rollercoaster, and I didn’t throw up (much).

Every bug is a teacher. Every crash is a lesson. Every “why isn’t this working?!” is a rite of passage.

<h1>🧠 Why This Project Matters</h1>
This isn’t just a portfolio piece — it’s a declaration. I wanted to assert my grasp over web development, and this project is living proof that I can adapt, learn, and build with technologies that once felt completely alien.

<h1>🙌 Final Thoughts</h1>
If you’re here to judge my code, please be gentle. If you’re here to learn, welcome aboard. If you’re here by accident, congratulations — you’ve discovered SPOTT.
